# PA Giving Day: Save the Date
Designed as a landing page for PA Giving Day, a one-day fundraising campaign. Users would be directed to this page prior to the campaign launch.
The page gives details of the campaign, answers FAQs and next steps, and generates excitement with a live countdown clock.

## Reflections

This was a side project I completed as a member of the Annual Giving team at PA. Post cards were being sent to the Andover community, directing them to a site that was not yet live. The landing page was created to answer any questions about the campaign and continute generating excitement for PA Giving Day.

The tools used in this project were Bootstrap, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
